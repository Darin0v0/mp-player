## üîß Technical Details

- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Audio/Video Processing**: FFmpeg/FFplay
- **UI**: Console-based with Unicode symbols
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of processes
- **Cross-platform**: No Windows-specific dependencies

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ffmpeg is not installed"**
   - Install FFmpeg using your package manager
   - Ensure it's available in your system PATH

2. **"No supported files found"**
   - Check file extensions are supported
   - Verify file paths are correct
   - Ensure files are not corrupted

3. **Audio/Video not playing**
   - Check if FFmpeg can process the file: `ffmpeg -i file.mp3`
   - Verify file permissions
   - Try with a different file format

4. **Search not finding files**
   - Check file permissions in search directories
   - Try searching with different terms
   - Some directories may be excluded for security reasons

5. **High CPU usage**
   - This is normal for video files
   - Audio-only files use minimal resources

### Performance Tips

- For large directories, consider using specific file extensions
- Video files use more resources than audio files
- The player automatically skips corrupted files
- Search results are limited to 100 files for performance

## üéØ Examples

```bash
# Start interactive mode
dotnet run

# Play your music collection
dotnet run ~/Music

# Play specific files
dotnet run "~/Downloads/song.mp3" "~/Videos/movie.mp4"

# Play from multiple sources
dotnet run "~/Music/Rock" "~/Music/Jazz" "~/Videos"

# Quick test with system sounds (if available)
dotnet run /usr/share/sounds
```
